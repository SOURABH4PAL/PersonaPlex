The story revolves around the life of Jack Gisburn, a successful artist who has abandoned his painting career to live a life of luxury with his wealthy wife, Mrs. Gisburn.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe story is narrated by an unnamed character, who is a friend of Jack's and has known him since his artistic heyday. The narrator is puzzled by Jack's sudden decision to give up painting and live a life of leisure. He visits Jack and his wife at their villa on the Riviera, where he observes their luxurious lifestyle and tries to understand why Jack has abandoned his art.\n\nThrough a series of conversations and observations, the narrator discovers that Jack's wife, Mrs. Gisburn, is a kind and unassuming woman who has no interest in art. Jack, on the other hand, is struggling with the loss of his artistic identity and the adoration of his former fans.
